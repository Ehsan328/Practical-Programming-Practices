If you want to contribute to any of the solutions:

1. Add your github username to the solution as `solve-USERNAME.lang`. So your solution might be named `solve-mammad.c`
2. Use descriptive identifiers to make the code easy to understand
3. Add comments to your code to make it even more readable
4. Do not use cryptic algorithms/highlevel language hacks. The idea behind this repo is "You can do it too"
